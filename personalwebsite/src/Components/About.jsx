    Hey there! I'm Rayat. I like to think of myself as a bootleg Tony Stark ‚Äî minus
    the billion-dollar lab and fancy AI (for now üòÖ). I'm a
    Computer Science student with a Math minor who loves Software Engineering, more specifically backend software
    engineering. I enjoy designing the logic, structure, and systems that
    keep apps running smoothly ‚Äî even when the server decides to be
    dramatic.

   My goals are clear and focused: I aspire to be a software engineer who creates meaningful impact through technology. I am passionate about building solutions that improve lives‚Äîwhether by contributing to advancements

   the success and positive influence I bring to the worlde right path. And for that I can never repay them fully but rather show them the success their son can have.
