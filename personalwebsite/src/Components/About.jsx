          Hey there! Some people dream of being superheroes â€” I just dream of
          debugging like Tony Stark. ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™m Rayat, a Computer Science student
          with a Math minor and a big curiosity for how things work. Iâ€™m
          passionate about software engineering, building meaningful projects,
          and learning something new every single day
