          Hey there! I'm Rayat. I like to think of myself as a bootleg Tony Stark ‚Äî minus
          the billion-dollar lab and fancy AI (for now üòÖ). I\‚Äôm a
          Computer Science student with a Math minor who loves Software Engineering, more specifically backend software
          engineering. I enjoy designing the logic, structure, and systems that
          keep apps running smoothly ‚Äî even when the server decides to be
          dramatic. `;

  Now it may sound plain but I want to build / contribute to tech in a way that it changes peoples lives. Now I dont 
  mean changing their lives financially but rather for medicine. Building software that can save someones life is something Im passionate about. Even if its not saving a life 
  if it can bring ease to your life I'm all up to build it. In addition I also want to make my parents proud. They always believed in me even when I thought they were just trying 
  to make my life so strict but as I'm getting older I see they really just want to make sure I'm on the right path. And for that I can never repay them fully but rather show them the success
  their son can have.
